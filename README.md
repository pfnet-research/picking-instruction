# PFN Picking Instructions for Commodities Dataset (PFN-PIC)
This dataset is a collection of spoken language instructions for a robotic system to pick and place common objects. Text instructions and corresponding object images are provided.

[Download (dataset-main.zip)](https://preferredjp.box.com/v/pfn-pic-dataset-main)

We consider a situation where the robot is instructed by the operator to pick up a specific object and move it to another location: for example, _Move the blue and white tissue box to the top right bin_.

<img src="example-annotation.png" alt="An example of image" title="An example of image and annotation" width="320" height="260">

This dataset consists of RGBD images, bounding box annotations, destination box annotations, and text instructions.

All objects in each image are annotated with bounding boxes.
Each bounding box is associated with a destination box and text instructions.
In addition to RGB images, depth images are also available in [PCD (Point Cloud Data) file format](http://pointclouds.org/documentation/tutorials/pcd_file_format.php).  Since the PCD files are relatively large (17GB), we provide them upon request.  Please create a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/pfnet-research/picking-instruction/issues) for the request.

The bounding box annotations, destination box annotations, and text instructions are provided in `en.train.jsonl`, `en.validation.jsonl`, `ja.train.jsonl`, `ja.validation.jsonl` which are all in
[JSON Lines text file format](http://jsonlines.org/).
Each line of these files represents the annotations for one image.  We recommend to use [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) or other JSON tools for pretty-printing.

## Statistics
| file name | #image | #bounding box | #instruction|
|:---|---:|---:|---:|
|en.train.json| 1060 | 25500 | 71701|
|en.validation.json| 20 | 353| 898 |
|ja.train.json| 1060 | 25500 | 76551 |
|ja.validation.json| 20 | 383 | 1149 |

Note that since some of the annotations include misspelling and do not appropriately specify target objects in the English validation set, we manually reviewed all the text instructions in the validation set and removed inappropriate instructions.
